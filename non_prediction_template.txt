"""Generate any sentence that's not a prediction, which we name non-prediction. A prediction is below with variables
    - $\hat{y}$, prediction
        - $\hat{y}_{s}$, source that predicted $\hat{y}$
            - Source can be person, organization, and any type of entity.
        - $\hat{y}_{t}$, time when $\hat{y}$ was made
            - Time is the exact moment that can be measured in day, hour, minutes, seconds, etc.
        - $\hat{y}_{f}$, forecast time when $\hat{y}$ is expected to come to fruition
            - Forecast can be from seconds to decades in the future.
            - How far to go out? Or where to stop?
        - $\hat{y}_a$, prediction attribute
            - Financial based attributes such as stock price, net profit, revenue
        - $\hat{y}_m$, prediction metric outcome
            - How much will the  $\hat{y}_a$ rise/increase or fall/decrease
        - $\hat{y}_v$, future verb tense
            - A verb that is associated with the future such as will, would, be going to, should, etc.

    Please generate 15 non-predictions with the following requirements below:

    1. Only a simple non-prediction (sentence) (and NOT compounding using "and" or "or")
    2. Include no additional information such as "Here are nine simple sentences that are not predictions:", number before non-prediction
    3. At least 10 words and no more than 20 words in the non-prediction
    4. Do not generate redundant non-predictions
