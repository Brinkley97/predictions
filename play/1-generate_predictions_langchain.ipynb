      "    2. $p_o$, health organization \n",
      "        - Can only be an organization or entity that is associated with the health prediction.\n",
      "    3. $p_t$, current time when $p$ was made\n",
      "        - Time is the exact moment that can be measured in day, hour, minute, second, etc.\n",

      "        - Forecast can be from a second to anytime in the future.\n",

      "    6. $p_s$, slope that indicates the direction of change in $p_a$\n",

      "    - Should have a forecast time ($p_f$) when $p$ is expected to come to fruition between 2025 to 2050.\n",
      "    - Use the five different templates and examples provided.\n",
